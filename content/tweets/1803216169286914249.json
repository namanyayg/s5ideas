  "text": "I will be hacking nights + weekends for the next 38 days.\n\nI am so happy to participate to s5 @_nightsweekends\n\nMy Initial idea is to build a journaling app that makes you fall in love with journaling. What do you thinkðŸ‘€?\n\nWhy am I building this?\n\nThere are a ton of journaling apps, but no one provides guidance. Journaling is hard: it's easy to keep writing the same things, get discouraged, forget to review the past months.\n\nMy goal is to fix this. I want to build a journal that focuses on personal growth and problem-solving.\n\nToday I'm launching the waitlist -> https://t.co/ZPEgb5TOuU\n\nThis week, I have:\n- refined the idea\n- built a mailing list\n- built a landing page\n\nEverything will be built in public, all in 6 weeks. Follow me if you want to see what I end up building.\n\ncc: @_buildspace, @_nightsweekends, #buildinginpublic",
