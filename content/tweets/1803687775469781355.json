  "text": "Okay, here is my idea for @_nightsweekends \n\nI use loom a to screen record and send client updates. Since I use their free plan I had to delete my older videos to record newer ones and their paid plan seems to be bit pricey (for me atleast).\n\nHence, I want to build a simple screen recorder which doesn't rely on subscription model. Also give freedom to the users to save it on their favorite cloud storage (starting with google drive). Am building this for myself so really excited for this. \n\nDo lmk your honest feedback/suggestion about this one :)\n\nCc: @_buildspace @FarzaTV",
