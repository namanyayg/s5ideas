  "text": "Hi @_buildspace fam, got any recommendations for a newsletter services that has monetisation/payment options for users in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nI was trying to connect by Substack account to a pre-existing @stripe account to only realise that it has been permanently deactivated. A new stripe account is also a no-go as stripe has made it an invite-only thing for Indian users. So I cannot depend on any newsletter service provider that depends on stripe as the payment gateway.\n\nSo any suggestions, ideas on how to get over this debacle?\n\nCc @_nightsweekends @FarzaTV \n\n#stripealternative #newsletter",
