  "text": "So excited to be a part of @_buildspaceâ€™s @_nightsweekends. \n\nAfter working with SMBs on their compliance and legal needs for several years, I want to create an easy to use solution (most likely a chatbot) for SMB owners to generate customized compliance policies and contracts that went beyond simple templates. Further, the chatbot will be able to answer compliance questions and direct them to compliance and legal professionals for further advise!  \n\nWould love feedback and thoughts on my idea! Thanks!",
